# My Homepage

Here's where I'll host my projects and resume. I need some potential employeers to stop by and be impressed, so contrary to my old site, 
this should be a more professional site. 

Sorry I don't have any cool CI tag things It's just static HTML and vuetify so what really needs to be tested or built. I know 
it makes my repo not look as flashy but I think the site itself should make up for my lack of README formating skills.
